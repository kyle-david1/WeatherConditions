# WeatherConditions

As a user, I want to enter a city name and be shown the current weather.
As a user, I want to see the 5 day forecast for a location.

Enter city into search bar and be returned with weather information for current conditions 
as well as 5 days into the future. 

This website derives functionality from the open weather API site
Two API calls made using fetch method to CurrentWeatherAPI and GeoAPI
GeoAPI was needed to gain a locations coordinates, in order to access the weather for those coordinates.

future developments will include color-coded icons, as well as a for-loop in JS to avoid redundant code.
